# Computer-Vision
The following project is an assignment from the Computer Vision material which consists of 2 tasks. For Task 1 regarding Digital Image Processing using OpenCV2 which contains the implementation of digital image processing to improve image quality using the Pooling technique. Task 2 discusses Transfer Learning using Torchvision Pre-trained CNN Models which contains Implementation of Transfer Learning methods for multi-classification cases using Deep Learning-based Computer Vision modeling, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT).
